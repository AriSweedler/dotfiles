# ZSH files for every machine
Machine-local shell scripts.

* Maybe they have dependencies that only exist on this machine
* Or accomplish tasks that only this machine needs to accomplish

Either way, these scripts do not live in my dotfiles. They will live in my
company-specific config file repo, or my machine-specific config repo (a very
minimal set of configuration that shouldn't be moved around)
