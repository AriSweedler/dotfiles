	# Reuse recorded resolution: record hand-resolved results to merge
	# conflicts. To get use of this feature, you have to enable it and then
	# it gets invoked in the following 3 unique situations:
	# * A new merge conflict (REcords the conflicted working tree files)
	# * Resolving the merge conflict (REcords the REsolution)
	# * An old merge conflict (REuses the resolution)
