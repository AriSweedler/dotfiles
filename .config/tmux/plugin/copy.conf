# copy-mode's workflow is, by default:
# * <Prefix>[ 	- Enter copy mode
# * <Space> 	- Start selection
# * <Enter> 	- Select & place on tmux clipboard
# * <Prefix>]	- Paste from tmux clipboard

# I like <Prefix>[ and <Prefix>] to enter copy mode and paste from it. But I
# want to use 'v' and 'y' to select and copy. To visually select and to yank.
# This is the muscle-memory I have because I use vim.
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi v send-keys -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi y send-keys -X copy-pipe pbcopy\; send-keys -X copy-selection-and-cancel

# Movement around during copy mode should use vim-style keybindings
set-option -g mode-keys vi
